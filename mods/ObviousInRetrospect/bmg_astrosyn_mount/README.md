# BMG Astrosyn Mount
- Mount to (ab)use an astrosyn between the frame and a BMG extruder. 
- Also works with a 2nd astrosyn between the BMG and the motor. 
- Reduces vibration and noise for high pressure advance values pretty dramatically. Might be worth testing on a Mobius.

## BOM
- 2 astrosyn dampers (which you might have pulled from your 2.1 during the upgrade)
- 2 M3x12 screws
- 6 M3x6 screws
- 2 Mx30 screws
- 2 M3 nuts

## Assembly
- Install the M3x12 screws facing the case into astrosyn_mount.stl (no nut trap holes).
- Install the M3 nuts in astrosyn_mount.stl.
- Install the M3x6 screws in bmg_mount.stl while you have access. The 6's attach the astrosyn to bmg_mount and go into the threaded side of the astrosyn. A non-ball screwdriver makes them easier to install angled from the inside where the motor will live.
- Mount an Astrosyn on a motor.
- Attach:  BMG | bmg_mount.stl | astrosyn | motor.
- Attach the whole assembly to the frame.
